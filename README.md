# System Design Primer (formatted)
This is a fork of the popular [donnemartin/system-design-primer](donnemartin/system-design-primer), with formatting improvements and rendered through MkDocs.
I created this fork to better organize the original content and to be able to publish it in a more reader-friendly format.

Find here the formatted primer:
